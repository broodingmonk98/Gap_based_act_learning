The hyperparameters.py was used to pick the hyperparameters (LinearSVC worked well enough and was significantly faster than rbf, so I stuck with it). You just have to run the scenes.py and yeast.py scripts. 
The final outputs, are graphs generated, one for each value of 't':
So 13 graphs for scenes dataset (as there are 13 labels) and 5 for scenes.
For the next graph to open up, just close the currently open graph.
