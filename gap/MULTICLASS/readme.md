First run generate_multilabel.py followed by mnist.py. Note: mnist.py
takes in additinoal arguments (optional). see code for more details.

For a faster program, run digits.py, which uses the 8*8 images available
in sklearn datasets, and is easier to learn, and much faster than the
28*28 MNIST images.
